# WIFI-JTAG

ESP8266 as wifi jtag adapter.

Here's lua code for nodemcu that listens to port 3335 
and talks remote_bitbang protocol of OpenOCD

When sufficiently debugged it 
should be used to send SVF bistream to the FPGA.

    interface remote_bitbang
    remote_bitbang_port 3335
    remote_bitbang_host jtag.lan
    jtag newtap tb276 tap -expected-id 0x020f10dd -irlen 10
    init
    scan_chain
    svf -tap tb276.tap project.svf
    shutdown

Currently it is just proof-of-concept which does boundary 
scan. At least it seems that gpio works and wiring is ok.

    Warn : Adapter driver 'remote_bitbang' did not declare which transports it allows; assuming legacy JTAG-only
    Info : only one transport option; autoselect 'jtag'
    adapter speed: 1000 kHz

Too bad SVF upload will not go.
Might be LUA is slow? 
It should be rewritten in C
