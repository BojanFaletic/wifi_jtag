# WIFI-JTAG

ESP8266 for $4 as WIFI JTAG adapter.
This could be the simplest, the cheapest and the slowest JTAG adapter.

Here's arduino code for ESP8266 which listens to port 3335 
and talks remote_bitbang protocol with OpenOCD.

It can upload SVF bistream over WIFI network to the FPGA.

Works for FPGA board TB276 (Altera Cyclone-4).

What works for one FPGA, doesn't neccessary work for the other. 
FPGA board TB299 (Xilinx Spartan-6) seems like everything is fine:

    svf file programmed successfully for 59 commands with 0 errors

But FPGA will not start. Maybe upload too slow?

# Pinout

The GPIO pinout:
    TDO=12, TDI=13, TCK=14, TMS=16, TRST=0, SRST=2, LED=15

TRST and SRST are reset signals usually used for ARM debugging.
Most FPGA don't need them. LED may be left unconnected too.
Avoid using GPIO0, GPIO2, GPIO15 for JTAG signals, as those
pins need to be at some defalut state at power on for ESP8266
to boot firmware. Use ESP-12 as it has has plenty of GPIO.

# Compiling

Precompiled binary is available in bin/

Default SSID=ssid PASSWORD=password

It has to be compiled to change SSID and PASSWORD.

To compile from source you need ESP8266 Arduino.
Download from http://arduino.cc and unpack arduino-1.6.4 or higher.
Then add support for ESP8266 in File->Default Settings->Additional Boards Manager URLs
enter URL:

    https://adafruit.github.io/arduino-board-index/package_adafruit_index.json

Select pull down menu Tools->Board->Board Manager
and instal ESP8266 (cca 30MB). Read more on
https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Unofficial-list-of-3rd-party-boards-support-urls#list-of-3rd-party-boards-support-urls

If you'd like to compile all tools from source
this project will build them all and also
add 8266 in arduino IDE and eclipse:

# Speed

JTAG upload is slow because OpenOCD creates network 
traffic with short packets of 1-3 bytes sending to and 
from WIFI-JTAG. Watch the traffic:

    tcpdump -A port 3335

Switching direction from receive to transmit takes lot of
time (100-300 ms). This is main reason for lack of decent speed.

Uploading FPGArduino https://github.com/f32c takes

750KB SVF to Altera in 4-5 minutes.

# Reliability

Firmware is useable but not completely stable,
sometimes freezes or reboots, when connected to 
WIFI access point even if JTAG is not used.
We recommend to power it on just before use.

ESP8266 library has problems with TCP stability.
UDP seems much more stable than TCP. When OpenOCD
gets UDP remote bitbang support, ESP8266 would
benefit!

# Improvement

There is much room for improvement of course: network protocol
from OpenOCD could be optimized to allow longer packets, buffering,
compression (instead of sending same sequence many times), use some
hardware optimization in the ESP8266 like SPI as JTAG accelerator, 
or SVF player approach from JTAGWhisperer.

# LUA (not useable)

LUA version of the above does the same protocol but in 
practice it will not work for longer transfers, only
boundary scan. Works unstable and often reboots. 
It is here just as a proof-of-concept.
