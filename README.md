# WIFI-JTAG

ESP8266 for $3 as WIFI JTAG adapter.
This could be the simplest, the cheapest and the slowest JTAG adapter.

Here's arduino code for ESP8266 which listens to port 3335 
and talks remote_bitbang protocol with OpenOCD.

It can upload SVF bistream over WIFI network to the FPGA 
(Currently tested only with Altera Cyclone-4 board TB276).

    interface remote_bitbang
    remote_bitbang_port 3335
    remote_bitbang_host jtag.lan
    jtag newtap tb276 tap -expected-id 0x020f10dd -irlen 10
    init
    scan_chain
    svf -tap tb276.tap project.svf
    shutdown

Here's OpenOCD log of remote_bitbang JTAG adapter made with
Arduino ESP8266.

    Warn : Adapter driver 'remote_bitbang' did not declare which transports it allows; assuming legacy JTAG-only
    Info : only one transport option; autoselect 'jtag'
    adapter speed: 1000 kHz
    Info : Initializing remote_bitbang driver
    Info : Connecting to jtag.lan:3335

LUA version of the above does the same protocol but in 
practice it will not work for longer transfers, only
boundary scan. It is here just as a proof-of-concept.

For real JTAG use Arduino C code - very slow but seems to work.
Precompiled binary is available in bin/

The GPIO pinout:
    TDO=2, TDI=14, TCK=12, TMS=13, TRST=0, SRST=16, LED=15

TRST and SRST are reset signals usually used for ARM debugging.
Most FPGA don't need them. LED may be left unconnected too.

Get ESP8266 Arduino is also very simple:
Download from http://arduino.cc and unpack arduino-1.6.4 or higher.
Then add support for ESP8266 by following instructions on
https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Unofficial-list-of-3rd-party-boards-support-urls#list-of-3rd-party-boards-support-urls

If you'd like to compile all tools from source
this project will build them all and also
add 8266 in arduino IDE and eclipse:
